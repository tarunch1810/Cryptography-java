# Cryptography-java
The Alice-Bob model has been implemented using the concept of multi threading
in Java where one thread represents Alice while the other thread represents Bob.
The sending and receiving action of message can be performed by both Alice and
Bob with encryption and decryption done at both ends to imitate real world scenario.
The ciphers designed for this project have worked successfully in encrypting text
with lowercase alphabets.
